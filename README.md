# SEIR Model in JavaScript

This is a JavaScript implementation of the classical infectious disease model SEIR (Susceptible → Exposed → Infected → Removed) used in epidemiology to simplify the modelling of infectious diseases. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SEIR_model)

Most of this code was copied from the wonderfull [Epidemic Calculator](http://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html) and rewritten in TypeScript and published on npm.

> Can be used in node.js and in the browser.

## Getting started

```npm install seir```

## Usage

```js
import SeirModel from 'seir';

const covid19 = new SeirModel({
  r0: 2.2,
  dDeath: 32 - 2.9,
  dIncubation: 5.2,
  dInfectious: 2.9,
  dRecoveryMild: 14 - 2.9,
  dRecoveryServere: 31.5 - 2.9,
  dHospitalLag: 5,
  cfr: 0.02,
  pServere: 0.2,
  dt: 2,
});

const timeline = covid19.calculate({
  population,
  r0ReductionPercent: 10,
  r0ReductionDay: 5,
  days: 300,
});

/*
[
  { deaths: 0, hospitalized: 0, recovered: 0, totalInfected: 1, infected: 1, exposed: 2 },
  { deaths: 0, hospitalized: 0, recovered: 1, totalInfected: 4, infected: 3, exposed: 5 },
  ...
]
*/
console.log(timeline);
```
